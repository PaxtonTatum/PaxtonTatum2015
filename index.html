        <h2>Here's My Story So Far&#8230;</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Paxton Tatum and I am a fine artist, designer, and illustrator based in Nashville, Tn. I graduated in 2008, from 		Austin Peay State University, with a major in Studio Art and a minor in Professional Education.</p>

		<p>My desire is to promote the Visual Arts as an effective means of communication and community building and to inspire others to pursue a career in the Arts.</p>

		<p>I enjoy spending time with friends, practicing Kiyojute Ryu Kempo, maintaining a drawing blog, reading, watching football, continuing to learn about the web and technology, and how to improve my skills as an artist everyday.</p>

		<p>My passion to help and serve others has led me into the world of books, education, technology, and the visual arts. I am dedicated, 		work well with others, and believe in going the extra mile. I enjoy training and educating others in order to solve obstacles they are 		facing. I believe that through a life of continuous learning, dedication, and integrity you can truly find success.</p>

       	 	<h2>Artistic Philosophy</h2>
       	 	<p>As a visual artist, I enjoy looking for the small detail in everything that I see and rendering that in my artwork. The focus of 			my work is very eclectic in subject matter and overall design.</p>

			<p>My favorite artistic medium is drawing. I love working with several different media, including: graphite, charcoal, pen & ink, and coloring pencils. Like photography, I enjoy creating tightly rendered and highly detailed drawings.</p>

			<p>The artistic influences on my work include the Great Renaissance Artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. I also 			admire the work of Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher.</p>

			<p>On an overall note, I passionately believe that a world without visual art would be a pretty bleak world. As my high school art 			teacher once said, "Art is Life, and Life is Art."</p>
